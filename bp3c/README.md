EEZ DIB BP3C is backplane for connecting up to three EEZ DIB peripheral modules. When power modules (e.g. [DCP405](https://github.com/eez-open/modular-psu/tree/master/dcp405)) are plugged into slot #1 and #2, their power outputs can be coupled in series or parallel to double max. output voltage or current.
