### Overview

The EEZ DIB DCP405 Power module is adopted EEZ H24005 [Power board](https://github.com/eez-open/psu-hw/tree/master/Power%20board) that can be housed in EEZ DIB chasis (e.g. _Bench Box 3_).

### Feature list
- Power input: 48 Vdc (e.g. Mean Well LRS-150F-48)
- Max. output power: 155 W (limited by Mean Well AC/DC module) 
- Voltage regulation (CV), 0 â€“ 40 V. Voltage set resolution (_U_SET_): 16-bit, read resolution (_U_MON_): 15-bit
- Current regulation (CC) with 3-range (50 mA, 500 mA, 5 A) software auto-ranging function. Current set resolution (_I_SET_): 16-bit, Current read resolution (_I_MON_): 15-bit for each range
- On-board power pre-regulator and bias power supply
